In this project, we implement and evaluate zero-shot methods for Named Entity Recognition (NER), based on the study by Xie et al. (2023): "An Empirical Study of Zero-Shot NER with ChatGPT". [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10035](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10035)

In addition to reproducing the baseline method proposed in the paper, we also design and test two additional zero-shot methods inspired by the same study.

The dataset used for the experiments is available at:

The model used is meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free via the together.ai API.
